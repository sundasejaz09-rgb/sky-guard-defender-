We developed Sky Guard Defender, an AI-powered autonomous drone system that transforms flood disaster response. By integrating real-time drone imagery with NASA satellite data, our system uses a custom YOLOv11 deep learning model to rapidly identify stranded individuals in flood zones with high accuracy (88% mAP)
